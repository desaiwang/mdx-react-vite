# My First Post

Hello there! This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph, with some **bold text**.

Here's a list of things:

1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Carrot

## A Section with some code

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Or, maybe you prefer it to be inline: `const greeting = 'Hello, world!';`
